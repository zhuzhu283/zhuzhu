<p>Over the many years since I was first asked, it’s been, at different times, the most asked question for me. I understand why so many people asked it: they love Matthew and they want him to be OK. Me too. But I always <span class="tooltip">bristled at<span class="tooltiptext">
    词源解释：来自古英语byrst鬃毛<br>
    衍生词bristling竖立的、发怒的；bristly有刚毛的、易怒的<br>
    词组搭配与例句：He bristled at public criticism.
  </span></span> that question from the press, because I couldn’t say what I wanted to say: “It’s his story to tell and I’m not authorized to tell it really, am I!”

I would have wanted to go on to say, “This is very <span class="tooltip">intimate<span class="tooltiptext">
    个人的，隐私的；暧昧的；知识详尽的<br>
    词源解释：in在某某里 【拉丁语intus,在内部】；<br>【-tim最高级后缀】ultimate终极的、optimal最佳的<br>
    词组搭配与例句：an intimately knowledge of ...某方面有详尽的知识<br> have intimate with sb和某人有性关系
  </span></span> personal stuff and if you don’t hear it from the actual person, it is, to my mind, <span class="tooltip">gossip<span class="tooltiptext">说三道四的</span></span> and I’m not gossiping about Matthew with you.” 
  Knowing that no response at all could do more damage, sometimes I would just say, “I think he’s doing well.” At least that doesn’t <span class="tooltip">amplify<span class="tooltiptext">词根amply，放大</span></span> the <span class="tooltip">spotlight<span class="tooltiptext">聚光灯，媒体和公众的注意</span></span> 
  and maybe he can have a <span class="tooltip">fraction<span class="tooltiptext">小部分；<br>词根 -fract-打破,打碎，<br>同源词fragment.n.碎片；<br>可联想基督徒分面包</span></span> of privacy as he tries to deal with this disease.
   But truly, I wasn’t exactly sure how Matthew was doing. As he’ll tell you in this book, he was keeping it a secret. And it took some time for him to feel comfortable enough to tell us some of what he was going through. 
   Over those years I didn’t really try to <span class="tooltip">intervene<span class="tooltiptext">干涉；<br>词源-ven,来到/inter里边；<br>同源词advent.到达；<br>踏足别人内在就是一种干涉</span></span> or <span class="tooltip">confront<span class="tooltiptext">面对，译成对峙</span></span> him, because the little I knew about addiction was that his <span class="tooltip">sobriety<span class="tooltiptext">sober.n&v冷静/清醒；<br>Twist in my sobriety 失常</span></span> was out of my hands.
    And yet, I would have periods of wondering if I was wrong for not doing more, doing something.
     But I did come to understand that this disease relentlessly<span class="tooltip">relentlessly<span class="tooltiptext">relent宽容仁慈，<br>relentless冷酷不留情</span></span> fed itself and was determined to keep going.</p>

<p>So, I just focused on Matthew, who could make me laugh so hard every day, and once a week, laugh so hard I cried and couldn’t breathe.
 He was there, Matthew Perry, who is <span class="tooltip">whip smart<span class="tooltiptext">超聪明</span></span> … charming, sweet, sensitive, very reasonable and rational. 
 That guy, with everything he was battling, was still there. The same Matthew who, from the beginning, 
 could lift us all up during a <span class="tooltip">grueling<span class="tooltiptext">艰苦的，<br>词源ghreu意味刮，磨，<br>gruel粗制的谷物，旧时穷人喝的稀粥，<br>同源词grit粗糙的, grind磨碎</span></span> <span class="tooltip">night shoot<span class="tooltiptext">夜晚拍摄</span></span> for the opening titles inside that fountain. 
 “Can’t remember a time I wasn’t in a fountain!” “What are we, wet?” “Can’t remember a time I wasn’t wet … I!” (Matthew is the reason we are all laughing in that fountain in the opening titles.)

</p>


 <p>
    After Friends I didn’t see Matthew every day, and I couldn’t even <span class="tooltip">hazard<span class="tooltiptext">词源西班牙语azar,骰子，赌博→冒险→危害；这里译为不敢猜测</span></span> a guess with regard to his well-being.


 </p>

 <p>
    This book is the ﬁrst time I’m hearing what living with and surviving his addiction really was. Matthew has told me some things, but not in this kind of detail. He’s now letting us into Matthew’s head and heart in honest and very exposed detail. And ﬁnally, no one needs to ask me or anyone else how Matthew’s doing. He’s letting you know himself.
 </p>

 <p>
    He has survived impossible odds, but I had no idea how many times he almost didn’t make it. I’m glad you’re here, Matty. Good for you. I love you.
 </p>
<p>—Lisa</p>

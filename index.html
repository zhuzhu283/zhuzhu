    I’d had it all. But it was all a trick. Nothing was going to fix this. It would be years before I even grasped the <span class="tooltip">notion<span class="tooltiptext">词源notice，除了意图之外，还有概念的意思</span></span> of a solution. Please don’t misunderstand me. All of those things—Julia and the dream house and <span class="tooltip">$1 million a week<span class="tooltiptext">如果我有女朋友和大房子，我还会烦恼吗…</span></span>—were wonderful, and I will be eternally grateful for all of them. I am one of the luckiest men on the planet. And boy did I have fun.
  </p>
  <p>
    They just weren’t the answer. If I had to do it all over again,
    would I still <span class="tooltip">audition<span class="tooltiptext">试镜</span></span> for Friends? 
    You bet your ass I would. 
    Would I drink again? You bet your ass I would.

My grandfather, the wonderful Alton L. Perry, grew up around an alcoholic father, and as a result, he never touched a drink in his life, all ninety-six long, wonderful years of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am not my grandfather.<br>
  
    I don’t write all this so anyone will feel sorry for me—I write these words because they are true. I write them because someone else may be confused by the fact that they know they should stop drinking —like me, they have all the information, and they understand the consequences—but they still can’t stop drinking. You are not alone, my brothers and sisters. (<span class="tooltip">addict<span class="tooltiptext">再次让我想到“内啡肽替代多巴胺”，在信息爆炸的时代，我们的生活都潜藏着“成瘾”危机</span></span>)
    <p>
      In the <span class="tooltip">sober<span class="tooltiptext">清醒的</span></span>  living house in Southern California, I had a view of West LA and two queen-size beds. The other bed was occupied by my assistant/best friend, Erin, a lesbian whose friendship I treasure because it brings me the joy of female companionship without the romantic tension that has seemed to ruin my friendships with straight women (not to mention, we can talk about hot women together). I’d met her two years earlier, at another <span class="tooltip">rehab<span class="tooltiptext">吸毒者和酗酒者的康复治疗</span></span> where she had been working at the time. I didn’t get sober back then, but I saw how wonderful she was in every way and promptly stole her from that sober living rehab and made her my assistant, and she became my best friend. She, too, understood the nature of addiction and would come to know my struggles better than any doctor I’d ever seen.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
      Despite the comfort that Erin brought to the situation,
       I still spent many sleepless nights in Southern California. 
       Sleep is a real issue for me, especially when I’m in one of these places.
        That said, I don’t think I have ever slept for more than four hours straight in my entire life.
         It didn’t help that we’d been watching nothing but prison documentaries 
         —and I was coming off so much <span class="tooltip">Xanax<span class="tooltiptext">（阿普唑仑）</span></span>
          my brain had fried to the <span class="tooltip">point<span class="tooltiptext">（说到点子上，这里为“认定这个事实”）</span></span> 
          where I was convinced that I was an actual prisoner and that this sober living place was an actual jail. 
          I have a <span class="tooltip">shrink<span class="tooltiptext">（v缩小，口语是心理医生、精神科医生；<br>这个词读起来很像吮吸棒棒糖的声音，把疾病想象成棒棒糖，医生来“缩小它”）</span></span>
           whose <span class="tooltip">mantra<span class="tooltiptext">口头禅</span></span>  is “<span class="tooltip">reality is an acquired taste<span class="tooltiptext">（生活需要慢慢品味）</span></span>”
            —well, I’d lost both my taste and smell of reality by that point;
             I had Covid of the understanding; I was completely <span class="tooltip">delusional<span class="tooltiptext">妄想症</span></span>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There was nothing delusional about the <span class="tooltip">Pain<span class="tooltiptext">（痛疼不是幻觉）</span></span>,
       though; in fact, it hurt so much I’d stopped smoking, 
       which if you knew how much I smoked, you’d think was a pretty sure sign that something very serious was wrong. 
       One employee of the place, whose name  <span class="tooltip">badge<span class="tooltiptext">（徽章，标记，象征v&n；<br>词源是骑士盾牌上的家族标识，哈利波特里面的badger（獾）之所以是badger，就是因为额前有类似徽章的花纹）</span></span> 
       might as well have read NURSE FUCKFACE, suggested taking an <span class="tooltip">Epsom salts bath<span class="tooltiptext">（泻盐浴）</span></span> 
       to alleviate the “discomfort.” You wouldn’t take a <span class="tooltip">Band-Aid<span class="tooltiptext">（邦迪创口贴；有时候意味权宜之计）</span></span> 
       to a road traffic accident; you don’t put someone in this much Pain in water filled with his own <span class="tooltip">sauce<span class="tooltiptext">调味汁，这段话意思是一位员工（Matty戏称他为臭脸护士）建议他泡泻盐浴来缓解毒瘾发作时的痛苦，Matty认为这无疑是让人泡在自己的苦汁里面受折磨</span></span>. 
       But reality is an acquired taste, remember, so I actually took the actual Epsom salts bath.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There I sat, naked, in Pain, howling like a dog being <span class="tooltip">ripped<span class="tooltiptext">撕碎</span></span> to <span class="tooltip">shreds<span class="tooltiptext">碎屑</span></span> 
      by <span class="tooltip">coyotes<span class="tooltiptext">土狼</span></span>. 
      Erin heard me—hell, people in San Diego heard me. She appeared at the bathroom door, 
      and looking down upon my sad, naked form as I <span class="tooltip">writhed<span class="tooltiptext">蠕动；词源同 wring,wriggle.；<br>想起来曹文轩有一本儿童文学，以孩子的视角记录爸爸写作的时候在沙发痛苦蠕动的情形——创作write就是痛苦到蠕动writhe）</span></span> 
      in Pain, she said very simply, “Do you want to go to the hospital?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If Erin thought it was hospital-bad, it was hospital-bad. Plus, she’d already noticed I wasn’t smoking.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That sounds like a pretty damn good idea to me,” I said in between howls.
      <p>
        Somehow, Erin helped me out of the bath and dried me off.
         I started to put my clothes back on just as a counselor—alerted by the <span class="tooltip">slaughter<span class="tooltiptext">动物被杀；前文提到Matty痛苦的时候像狗哀嚎，这里戏称顾问是被狗狗凶杀案吸引过来的邻居）</span></span>
         of a dog on the premises（屋内）, presumably—appeared at the door.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        “I’m taking him to the hospital,” Erin said.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Catherine, the counselor, just so happened to be a beautiful blond woman to whom I had apparently <span class="tooltip">proposed<span class="tooltiptext">求婚</span></span> upon my arrival,
         so she probably wasn’t my biggest fan.
          (Not kidding, I had been so out of it when we’d arrived that I’d asked her to marry me, and then promptly fell down a flight of stairs.)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        “This is just drug-seeking behavior,” 
        Catherine said to Erin as I continued to dress. “He’s going to ask for drugs at the hospital.”
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Well, this marriage is off, I thought.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        By now, the howls had alerted others that there were probably <span class="tooltip">canine entrails<span class="tooltiptext">狗的内脏，还是呼应前文的比喻</span></span> all over the bathroom floor,
         or someone was in real Pain. 
         The head counselor, Charles—think: male model father, 
         homeless mother—joined Catherine in the doorway, to help her block our expected exit.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Block our exit? What were we, <span class="tooltip">twelve years old?<span class="tooltiptext">Charles等顾问认为Matty去医院是取拿药drug，因此堵在门口</span></span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        “He’s our patient,” Catherine said. “You don’t have the right to take him.”
      </p>
      
      <p>
        “I know Matty,” Erin insisted. “He isn’t trying to get drugs.” Then Erin turned to me.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        “Do you need to go to the hospital, Matty?” I nodded and screamed some more.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        “I’m taking him,” Erin said.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Somehow, we pushed past Catherine and Charles, 
        out of the building, and into the parking lot. 
        I say “somehow” not because Catherine and Charles made much of a <span class="tooltip">fuss<span class="tooltiptext">（大惊小怪）</span></span> about stopping us, but because every time my feet touched the ground, the Pain became even more excruciating.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Up there in the sky,
         looking down on me with <span class="tooltip">scorn<span class="tooltiptext">蔑视，轻视v&n</span></span>, 
         caring not for my <span class="tooltip">agony<span class="tooltiptext">剧痛</span></span>, was a bright yellow ball.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        What’s that? I thought through <span class="tooltip">paroxysms<span class="tooltiptext">阵发性的，他在痛苦的间隙思考</span></span> of agony.
         Oh, the sun. Right … I didn’t get out much.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        “We have a <span class="tooltip">high-profile<span class="tooltiptext">高调的，高姿态，这里是“名人”；<br>profile画像、剪影）</span></span> coming in with severe <span class="tooltip">abdominal<span class="tooltiptext">腹部</span></span> pain,
        " Erin said into her phone as she unlocked the car. 
        Cars are stupid, ordinary things until you’re not allowed to drive them, at which point they become magical boxes of freedom and signs of a successful previous life. 
        <span class="tooltip">freedom<span class="tooltiptext">（得不到的自由才叫自由）</span></span> 
        Erin lifted me into the passenger seat, and I lay back. My belly was twisting in agony.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Erin got into the driver’s seat, 
        turned to me, and said, “Do you want to get there fast, 
        or do you want me to avoid the LA <span class="tooltip">potholes?<span class="tooltiptext">（洛杉矶的烂路，全是洞）</span></span>”
      </p>
      
      <p>
        “Just get there, woman!” I managed to say.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        By now Charles and Catherine had decided to up their efforts to <span class="tooltip">thwart<span class="tooltiptext">阻挠</span></span> 
        us and now stood in front of the car, blocking us. 
        Charles’s hands were lifted, his palms facing us, as if to say “No!”, 
        as though three thousand pounds of motor vehicle could be stopped with the force of his 
        <span class="tooltip">mitts<span class="tooltiptext">（手套）</span></span>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To make matters worse, Erin couldn’t start the car. 
        The ignition works via telling the car to start out loud, because you know, I was on Friends.
         Catherine and the Palms didn’t <span class="tooltip">budge<span class="tooltiptext">让开，给人挪地儿；尽管词源跟bridge桥不沾边，同样是b-dge，一个是挪地，一个搭桥，都有“让人有路可走”的意味</span></span>. 
         Once she worked out how to start the damn thing, there was only one thing more to do: Erin revved the <span class="tooltip">engine<span class="tooltiptext">踩下引擎</span></span>, put the car in drive, and <span class="tooltip">slewed<span class="tooltiptext">突然转向</span></span> 
         it up and onto a <span class="tooltip">curb<span class="tooltiptext">马路牙子；控制v</span></span>
         —the <span class="tooltip">jolt<span class="tooltiptext">震动</span></span> of that action alone,
          <span class="tooltip">ricocheting<span class="tooltiptext">跳弹，电脑自带的小游戏星际弹球就叫这个rɪkəʃet</span></span> 
          through my entire body, almost caused me to die right there. With two wheels up on the curb,
           she revved past Catherine and Charles, and out into the street. They just watched us drive away, 
           though by this point I would have urged her to drive over them—not being able to stop screaming is a very scary state to be in.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If I were just doing this to get drugs, then I deserved an Oscar. “Are you aiming for the <span class="tooltip">speed bumps?<span class="tooltiptext">减速带</span></span> 
        I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I’m kind of struggling right now. Slow down,” I begged her. 
        We both had tears streaming down our faces.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        “I have to go fast,” Erin said, her brown,
         compassionate eyes looking over at me with concern and fear. “We have to get you there now.”
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It was right about here that I drifted out of consciousness. (A 10 on the pain scale is losing consciousness by the way.) <span class="tooltip">Oscar<span class="tooltiptext">（笨蛋助理和痛苦不堪的主人公，简直像在演电影）</span></span>
